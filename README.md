# Sign Language Translation
This project is a sign language translation system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python. The CNN is trained on a dataset of sign language images and corresponding translations to learn to recognize and translate different signs into text.

# Requirements
* Python 3.6 or higher
* TensorFlow 2.x
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
# Usage
* Clone or download the repository.
* Install the required libraries (see "Requirements" section above).
* Download the sign language dataset and extract it to the dataset folder.
* Modify the constants at the top of the train.py file (e.g. BATCH_SIZE, EPOCHS, etc.) to match your desired training configuration.
* Run the train.py script to train the CNN model.
* Run the predict.py script to translate a single sign from an image or video file.
# Customization
You can customize the project by modifying the code in the train.py and predict.py files. For example, you can change the architecture of the CNN model, the preprocessing and augmentation methods applied to the dataset, or the way the translations are generated.

Note: Make sure to have a sufficient amount of data and compute resources available for training and evaluating the model. The performance of the translation system may vary depending on the quality and diversity of the dataset and the complexity of the model.
